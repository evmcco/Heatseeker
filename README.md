# The Problem

If you're a sneakerhead, you know how hard it can be to get the most hyped sneakers for retail price when they come out. The best chances to get them are through your local sneaker shops, who will often raffle off the opportunity to purchase limited release sneakers. The issue with this is that these stores only market their raffles via Instagram, and if you miss the post you could miss the raffle entirely.

# Solution

In addition, Heatseeker gives you the most important info at your fingertips to help you in your quest to acquire your "grails".
